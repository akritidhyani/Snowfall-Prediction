# Snowfall Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict snowfall patterns in the Uttarakhand, India, addressing the impact of climate change on snowfall rates. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict future snowfall trends.

## Project Structure
- **raw_data_csv_format.csv**: CSV file containing raw data for training and testing the machine learning model.
- **Machine_Learning_Project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook providing a detailed walkthrough of the machine learning process.
- **Snowfall.pptx**: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project findings.

## Problem Statement
Climate change has led to declining snowfall rates in the Uttarakhand, India, impacting various aspects of life and ecology. This project addresses the following challenges:
- Analyzing historical snowfall data to understand patterns and trends.
- Developing machine learning models to predict future snowfall rates based on climatic variables.
- Providing insights to policymakers and stakeholders for better management of resources and adaptation strategies.

### Key Points:
- **Delayed Snowfall Onset**: Climate variability has led to delayed snowfall onset in recent years, affecting agricultural practices and water resources.
- **Impact of Western Disturbances**: Changes in wind patterns and frequency of western disturbances influence snowfall patterns in the region.
- **Climate Change Effects**: Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns contribute to reduced snowfall rates, posing challenges to local communities and ecosystems.
